* rewrite sessions to not use this or prototype etc  and to use vows
  
* cache  
  Set:
  “Cache-Control: public, must-revalidate, max-age=0”
 for resources that need to be updated or at least revalidated on
  every new visit. 
  
 Set max-age and expires to infinity or a year or so and change the
 url if they update 
 
Use Cache-Control: No-store for pages should not be cached at all 

Set expires and max-age both and the same, why not!
Also set Cache-Control:public
